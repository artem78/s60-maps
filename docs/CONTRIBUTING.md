Before make contribution to this repository please read these simple rules.

# General rules
- Before create any feature and make pull request it's recommended to create [new issue](https://github.com/artem78/s60-maps/issues/new) first and describe what you want to do

# Branches
There are two main branches:
- **develop** — branch for current development process
- **master** — contains only stable changes when new release made

Make your pull request to the `develop` branch and do not touch `master`.

# Localization

**Many localization strings need to be translated! We need translators for update them.**

If you can help with translation of S60Maps to your language please read [this instruction](https://github.com/artem78/s60-maps/wiki/How-to-create-new-translation) how to do this.
